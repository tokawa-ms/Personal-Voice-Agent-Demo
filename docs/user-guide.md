## Tips and Best Practices

### Voice Recognition

- Speak clearly and at a moderate pace
- Ensure you're in a quiet environment for best results
- The system uses continuous recognition, so you can speak naturally
- Wait for the system to process before speaking again

### Personal Voice Quality

- The quality of synthesized speech depends on your Personal Voice profile
- Select the appropriate voice model (`DragonLatestNeural` or `PhoenixLatestNeural`) based on your preference
- Different languages may have different voice characteristics
- Ensure you select the correct language matching your Personal Voice profile

### Image Upload

- Supported formats: JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP
- Recommended size: Under 5MB for best performance
- Images are stored in browser storage (Base64 encoded)
- Clear images if you need to free up browser storage

### Connection Issues

If you experience connection problems:

1. Check your internet connection
2. Verify all API keys and endpoints are correct
3. Ensure your Entra ID token hasn't expired (generate a new one if needed)
4. Check browser console for detailed error messages

### Browser Storage

The application stores data locally in your browser:
- Configuration settings
- Uploaded images
- No conversation history is stored (for privacy)

To reset everything:
1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Go to Application ‚Üí Local Storage
3. Delete items with keys starting with `pva_`

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Configuration panel won't close

**Solution**: Make sure you've clicked "Save & Close" or successfully tested the connection with auto-close enabled.

### Problem: Microphone doesn't work

**Solution**: 
- Check browser permissions for microphone access
- For local development, some browsers require HTTPS for microphone access
- Grant microphone permission when prompted

### Problem: No sound is played

**Solution**:
- Check your system volume
- Ensure Speaker Profile ID is correctly configured
- Verify the Personal Voice Model (DragonLatestNeural or PhoenixLatestNeural) is selected
- Verify the language setting matches your Personal Voice profile
- Check browser console for synthesis errors

### Problem: Agent doesn't respond

**Solution**:
- Verify Agent Service connection settings
- Check if Entra ID token is valid (tokens expire)
- Ensure the Agent ID is correct
- Check browser console for API errors

### Problem: Images don't load after refresh

**Solution**:
- Check if browser storage is enabled
- Verify storage quota hasn't been exceeded
- Try re-uploading the images
